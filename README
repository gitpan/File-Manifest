Manifest


A user-friendly version of ExtUtils::Manifest.  In addition to
creating a file listing, stores checksums for each file.  Three
reports are built-in to the simple command line interface:

MISSING - Lists files that were in the old manifest but are missing
          from the new manifest.

DIFF    - Splits output into a listing of files that were add, removed,
          and modified.  Output is similar to diff in context mode.

OVERLAP - Reports which files are in both trees.
